The folder structure might sound different than usual cause I try to follow seperations of concens. 
1. Feature folder will have custom code part of the app. Lets say their is a special or a specific component requirerd and is not requirerd elsewhere
2. Components or parts that are common to the whole app. i.e they can be used by the whole app will stay in source directory.
